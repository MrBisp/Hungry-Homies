# Backstory

In an once-vibrant world, every individuals voice was a unique thread in the rich tapestry of society.
People freely shared their stories, opinions, and experiences, creating a harmonious symphony of diverse perspectives.

But then a dark entity emerged from the depths of skepticism and nihilism.
He believed that there is no truth, and that we are all just puppets of a greater force. 
Principles once held dear were now seen as mere illusions, and the fabric of reality was torn asunder. 
Principles such as listening to others, being open-minded, and being kind were now seen as weaknesses. 
The only thing that matter is power, which comes from controlling what others believe to be true.

To fight back, the entities known as Demdertror, decided to create a world where everyone's voice is heard.
Even those who do not believe in the principles of Demdertror. 
To fight back, they created an app where biological people, can review bars, restaurants, and other places.
Each time a review is made, it adds to the resistance of the dark entity.
Each reviews has an emoji, which symbolizes the feeling of the reviewer. This is not just a feeling, since this emoji is actually real in this world.
The emoji is a representation of the reviewer's soul.
